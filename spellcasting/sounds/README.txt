Place your sound effects here!

Supported formats: .wav, .mp3, .ogg (most browsers support all three, but .wav and .mp3 are safest).

For enemy death, you can put multiple files in the sounds/enemydeath/ folder (e.g. enemy_die1.wav, enemy_die2.mp3, crate.mp3, etc). The game will play a random sound from this folder when an enemy dies.

You can swap in your own sounds by adding or replacing files in this folder.

Example usage in code: new Audio('sounds/enemydeath/enemy_die1.wav')
